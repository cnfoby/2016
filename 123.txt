#6:  Get Enough Calcium to Regulate Body Composition
Calcium is famous for its role in supporting strong bones and teeth, but in recent years the scientific community has established that this important mineral has a much broader role. Evidence indicates that calcium plays an important role in the regulation of body composition, and research shows that people who consume medium to high amounts of calcium (more than 6 grams per day) have a lower body fat percentage. One study found that a difference of 1 gram in daily calcium intake corresponded, on average, to an 8 kilogram difference in body weight!
Therefore, if you are looking to lower your body fat percentage, be sure to include plenty of foods that contain calcium in your fat loss diet plan. Dairy products are one of the best natural sources of calcium, but also many green leafy vegetables and seafood provide a good source of this fat loss promoting mineral. To get the most out of calcium's benefits, combine calcium rich foods with foods high in vitamin D (vitamin D promotes the absorption of calcium from food in the intestines).

#7:  Consume Zinc-Rich Foods to Control Appetite and Fat Storage
Zinc supplementation has been shown to increase the levels of circulating leptin in people with a zinc deficiency. Leptin is a hormone that plays an important role in regulating the body's energy expenditure, appetite, and fat storage. Leptin directly communicates to the brain when you should feel full and stop eating. Many experts firmly believe that inadequate leptin levels are the root cause of overeating, food cravings, and obsession with food. Zinc is found in large quantities in oysters, poultry, and red meat.

#8:  Consume Enough Chromium-Rich Foods to Maintain Lean Body Mass
When combined with exercise, a diet rich in chromium may help increase or maintain lean body mass and aid in fat loss, research suggests. These positive effects on body composition are believed to result from chromium's ability to enhance insulin's activity and to improve insulin sensitivity. Mild cases of chromium deficiency are relatively common in Western countries due to the high consumption of processed foods (food processing significantly decreases the chromium content of foods). Physically active people and people who consume a lot of coffee, tea, and/or sugar also have a higher risk of becoming deficient in chromium. Good dietary sources of chromium include romaine lettuce, tomatoes, whole grains, onions, and potatoes. Absorption of chromium is enhanced by vitamin C.
